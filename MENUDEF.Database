1, "The High Precision Energy gun, or \nHi.P.E gun for short; is a powerful \npump action weapon that boasts \nsupreme accuracy at great range. \nAble to quickly  fire shots back to \nback, the Hi.P.E Gun is the go-to \nweapon for ranged combat.  in \naccurate hands it has the power to \ntake out any target in a Hurry! it's \nclip is small and takes in ammo one \nround at a time, so this weapon has \na fair bit of downtime to account for."
2, "Equal parts laser cannon and railgun. \nthe HiperBeam launches super condensed \nenergy beams that can hit distant \ntargets \ca instantly and without \nany loss in power,\cj making it the \nsuperior choice for extreme combat \nranges. \n\nit's shots can be charged for more \nconcentrated damage but the shot \nwill auto fire if held too long to \nprevent heat damage on the weapon \nitself. beware of the kickback \nthough, it's fierce!"
3, "an explosive launching cannon that \nfires specialized minibombs that \nexplode on contact with anything. \nthe #1 choice for area damage \nwithin the neumodian arsenal! it's 6 \nshot clip gives you plenty of bang for \nyour buck but don't get too trigger \nhappy, not only can you blow \nyourself up but you'll have to reload \none minibomb at a time."
4, "A device popular with field \nmedics, the Medicarbine \nlaunches specialized darts \ncontaining a treatment nano-\nserum to offer long distance \nfirst-aid. the same rounds can \nstill be used like regular \nbullets against threats.\n\nwithin the Neumodian \ncompetitions, the medicarbine \noffers some aim assistance when \ntargeting your teammates and \n\cahas the dubious trait of \nbypassing shields."
5, "The signature weapon of a rival \nspecies, but with neumodian \nquality modernizations. This \nlightweight ranged weapon can \nquickly reload after each shot. \ngive the dart time to prime to \nfire poison laced darts that \nnegate all healing. \n\na good fit for marksmen on \nthe move who'd like to be a \nconstant threat to the enemy \nteam."
6, "this weapon spews flames through \na whip-like aparatus that earns \nthe weapon it's name, the \nflametongue is a potent zoning \nweapon that \caignores shields\n\cj and can force multiple \nopponents back in a torrent of \nflames while setting them \nablaze in the process. and \nwhile firing it can emit slow \nmoving embers to catch foes \njust out of reach. \n\nalthough not a fast killer the \nweapon can be hard to approach, \nmaking it useful as a defensive \ntool."
7, "An electrical beam cutter specially \ndesigned to cut through shields \nand foes like butter. the \nvoltspear does extra damage to \nprojected shields and deals most \nof it's damage up close, despite \nthat it holds a surprising amount \nof range, and hits all things \ninstantly.\n\nthe weapon has a near endless \nsupply of ammo but can build heat \nrather quickly."
//8, "The T.A.G Missile launcher is a hefty \nweapon that launces guided missiles. \nhold the trigger to commence the \ntargeting system and release to fire once \nyour target is locked in! guided missiles \nare slow and noisy, but are more \naggressive towards airborne targets. \n\nconfident users can forgo the lock-on \nsystem to launch faster, more \ndestructive missiles."
8, "one of the biggest handheld \nweapons in our arsenal. the \nBasher Gating gun will terminate \nanything in your way with a \nheavy barrage of plasma fire. \nand it comes with a personal \nshield projector to help you \nrule the battle field. \n\nthe basher is noisy and takes \na bit to get going however and \nit can take a while to reload if \nyou run completely out. This bad \nboy take's commitment."

1, "the Blitzer offers close quarters \nfirepower through a circular \nspread of projectiles with a \nprojected shield to help close \nthe gap. the blitzer's shield \ncan also be used for defense \nagainst ranged threats. and \nwill suppress explosives that \nhit it directly. \n\nstrong in close quarters, the \nBlitzer's shield gives it added \nutility through self defense, \nmaking it a great option for \ngetting through enemy fire."
2, "This oddly named machine gun fires a \nrapid barrage of high velocity shots, \n\cafaster than the trail visible to the \nnaked eye,\cj though it has some \nspread it can still hit distant targets \nconsistently. while it also bosts a \nlarge clip and a brisk reload, it's \npower is very low however. the \nrepidifier's weak but assured damage \nmakes it great for support fire, or for \ncleaning up weakened foes."
3, "There's been many attempts through \nour kind's history to weaponize the \nmost abundant resource we had, \nice; and the Thrice gun was our \nmost successful attempt in generations, \n\nthis rifle flash freezes a triplet of \nsolid icicles to launch in a 3-way \nspread for wide mid-ranged \ncoverage, and at point blank the \nweapon deals tremendous damage."

6, "A crafty weapon that fires Arrow \nshaped projectiles that head \ntowards the direction the gun \nis pointing at. though some may \ncall it as a silly and novel \ndevice. the ability to curve \nshots around terrain and into \nfoes is nothing to be trifled \nwith. in the right hands you \ncan mess with the minds and \nmovements of your opponent and \nfight from relative safety!"
7, "designed to work against \nmegafauna with hide tough \nenough to resist most weapons, \nthe crisperizer fires large \nnuclear blasts to cook the \nthreat from the inside-out. \n\nthe version used in the \ncompetitions do not work this \nway for obvious reasons, \nhowever the crisperizer serves \nas a well rounded weapon that \n\cadeals critical damage to \nburning targets."
8, "Launches a rapid volley of burning \nmaterial that bounces along the \nground. this weapon might seem \npointless in a direct fight but \nit can keep approaching foes at \nbay with a dense barrage of \nbouncing flames. and if the foe \nis too deep  into the weapon's \nfire they will go up in flames \nthemselves. \n\nworks great at high \nground too!"
9, "sharing it's origins with the \nCrossbow, the stinger has been \nelevated from a gangly crank \noperated dart shooter to the \nrapid needler gun of today. The \nstinger sprays poison needles on \ntrigger pull that can poison a \ntarget if enough of them land in \nsuccession. the needles also do \ncritical damage to poisoned \ntargets. \n\nwith steady hands the stinger \ncan be deadly up close, but at \nrange it is weak and inaccurate."
10, "A device that launches cylindrical \nmagnetic proximity mines that \ndetonate once an identified enemy \ndraws near. four can be placed at \nany given moment.\n\nthe mines cannot be placed too \nclose to one another and have a \nbrief delay before exploding. so \nusers will need to be crafty with \nwhere they place them."
11, "a specialized medical device that \nencases an ally in a protective \nbarrier that heals the subject. \nthe barrier can reduce a single \nhit by half of it's damage but \nwill break the shield and end the \nhealing. the protector can also \nblock statuses that would have \neffected the subject. \n\nthe shield remains until the \nsubject is fully healed and \nlingers for 5 seconds afterwards. \nmaking this a handy tool for \nroaming teammates who need healing \non the go."
